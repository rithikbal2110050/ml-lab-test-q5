# Given the provided evaluation metrics, MLP and SVM seem to perform relatively well, with similar test accuracies and R2 scores. However, you should also consider the factors mentioned above and possibly conduct further experiments (e.g., cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning) to make a more informed decision about which model is best suited for your specific problem.
